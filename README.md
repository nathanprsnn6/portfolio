# Hi there! I'm Nathan Personeni 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate **Computer Science student** currently in my second year of a Technical Bachelor's Degree at **IUT Annecy**. 

I have always been a curious person, which is exactly why I fell in love with development. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving problems, and understanding how things work behind the scenes. For me, coding isn't just about syntax—it's about building tools that make sense.
